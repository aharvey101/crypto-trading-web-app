## To Do :

### Backend:
Refactor routes:
[] Refactor the trade-input and trade-management route so that there is only 1 trade route, I did it wrong to begin with
[] Refactor trade-input form names to be trade[input] so we can get rid of all those variables

#### Trade Input Form
*[] Style
*[] fix date input problem
*[] update route to take all information to the DB
*[] make form output a string for the script to run
*[]

#### Trade Management
* [x] Fix trades not showing in the table (probably a route thing)
* [] 

#### Individual Trade
[x] Edit page
  [x] route
  [] 
[] Show trade

#### Backend Css:

[] Side pane nav
[] make page a grid
