## To Do :

### Backend:

Refactor routes:
[] Refactor the trade-input and trade-management route so that there is only 1 trade route, I did it wrong to begin with
[] Refactor trade-input form names to be trade[input] so we can get rid of all those variables

#### Trade Input Form

_[] Style
_[] fix date input problem
_[] update route to take all information to the DB
_[] make form output a string for the script to run
\*[]

#### Trade Management

- [x] Fix trades not showing in the table (probably a route thing)
- []

#### Individual Trade

[x] Edit page
[x] route
[x]Show trade

#### Backend Css:

[] Side pane nav
[] make page a grid

### Fix all minor issues
